# HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition

## DATASET USED
The dataset used in this analysis is provided from IBM HR to study about employee attrition from the Kaggle. 

## OBJECTIVE
Employee attrition is the rate at which employees leave a company. The goal of this analysis is to model employee attrition and determine the most dominant contributing factors that govern this turnover. Through this kind of analysis, we can understand how many employees are likely to leave, while also determining which employees are at the highest risk and for what reasons.

I have first performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data using various libraries like pandas,seaborn,matplotlib etc..

Then I have also used feature selection techniques like RFE (a wrapper method )to select the features. The data is then oversampled using the SMOTE technique in order to deal with the imbalanced classes. Also the data is then scaled for better performance.

## TOOLS
Python - Data modelling using LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier, Data preprocessing using LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder

Lastly I have trained many ML models from the scikit-learn library for predictive modelling and compared the performance using Precision, Recall and other metrics .
